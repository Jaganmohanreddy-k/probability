# probability
Probability has something to do with a chance. It is the study of things that might happen or might not. We use it most of the time, usually without thinking of it. We donâ€™t perform actual probability problems in our daily life but use subjective probability to determine the course of action or any judgment. Everything from the weather forecasting to our chance of dying in an accident is a probability.
